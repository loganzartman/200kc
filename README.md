#Learning-SDL2
Watch me try to learn C and SDL2 at the same time!

###Building:
Good luck! On Windows with MinGW and MSYS installed:

Download the [SDL2 development library](https://www.libsdl.org/download-2.0.php) and drop the SDL2 folder in the root directory of the repository.  You should be able to run `make` and produce a binary.

I've intentionally committed the Windows binary in case I have something set up poorly.
